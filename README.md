Habit Tracker
A simple Habit Tracker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features: 
Displays months, and clicking on a month reveals a table with days and habits.
By default, all habits are marked with a cross (✗). Clicking on a habit changes it to a tick (✓) and increases the streak counter by 1.
Option to add new activities and delete existing ones.

Future Enhancements: 
User Login: Implement authentication to allow personalized habit tracking.
Data Storage: Store habit data so users can track progress over time, even after refreshing or logging out.
